# Testing for crawler and the pagedir module

To test these modules simply run the following command:

```bash
make test &> testing.out
```

The command will produce a "testing" directory and a series of directories in it 
which each contain results produced by using crawler and the pagedir module. Testing.out 
will contain all the exit codes and error messages produced by the tests.
