<p>An <b>academic term</b> or <b>term</b> is a portion of an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_year" title="Academic year" class="mw-redirect">academic year</a>, the time during which an educational institution holds classes. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_timetable" title="School timetable">schedules</a> adopted vary widely.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <b>semester</b> system divides the academic year into two terms, which are usually 14–20 weeks each.</li>
<li>A <b>trimester</b> system divides the academic year into three terms which can be as short as eight weeks or as long as 16 weeks each.</li>
<li>A <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_quarter_(year_division)" title="Academic quarter (year division)">quarter</a></b> or <b>quadmester</b> system divides the academic year into four terms, up to 12 weeks each, and generally counts the summer as one of the terms.</li>
</ul>
<p>In most countries, the academic year begins in late summer or early autumn and ends during the following spring or summer. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere" title="Northern Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a> countries, this means that the academic year lasts from August, September or October to May, June or July. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere" title="Southern Hemisphere">Southern Hemisphere</a> countries, the academic year aligns with the calendar year, lasting from February or March to November or December. The summer may or may not be part of the term system.</p>

<p>A 'semester' (from the Latin meaning "six-monthly") has come to mean either of two academic terms, generally excluding the summer or January terms, if any, and so can be 12 to 20 weeks long. The word 'semester' is sometimes used as a synonym for a 'term', as in a 'summer semester'.</p>
<p>A 'trimester' (from the Latin meaning "three-monthly") divides the academic year into three periods, separated by breaks. In some jurisdictions,<sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources" title="Wikipedia:Citing sources"><span title="The text preceding this tag needs specification. (March 2012)">specify</span></a></i>]</sup> "trimester" is used in its original meaning to indicate a quarter system (since three months is exactly a quarter of a year), or a variation of it.</p>
<p>A 'quarter' or 'quadrimester' system treats the summer term on an equal footing with the other terms. It divides the academic year into four quarters, each of which is usually 12 weeks long. Three of the four quarters - Fall, Winter and Spring, operating from September through June or August through May, are thus equivalent to two 18-week semesters. Thus, when American academic universities convert academic credits between the semester/trimester and quarter systems, 36 quarter hours convert to 24 semester hours (2/3 conversion factor) while 36 semester hours convert to 54 quarter hours (3/2 conversion factor).</p>

<p>In most of Australia, the primary and secondary school year typically lasts from late January or early February to mid-December, and is split into four terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Term 1 starts in late January or early February and ends in late March or early April (often in close proximity to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter" title="Easter">Easter</a>).</li>
<li>Term 2 starts in mid-to-late April and ends in late June or early July.</li>
<li>Term 3 starts in mid-July and ends mid-to-late September.</li>
<li>Term 4 starts in early-to-mid October and ends mid-December.</li>
</ul>
<p>Terms 4&amp;1 (rolled over) and 2&amp;3 are respectively usually deemed 'summer' and 'winter' for purposes of sports participation and uniform standards. Australian states and territories vary their approach to Easter when determining the dates for the holiday at the end of Term 1.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The exact dates vary from year to year, as well as between states, and for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_school_(government_funded)" title="Public school (government funded)" class="mw-redirect">public</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school" title="Private school">private school</a>. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania" title="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> until and including 2012, the school year was split into three terms, the first one being the longest and including an extended Easter holiday. However, in 2013 Tasmania introduced a four-term year, to conform to the rest of the country.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> The terms are separated by a holiday lasting two weeks with the Christmas/Summer holidays between the end of a school year and the start of another lasting six weeks.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Most Australian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University" title="University">universities</a> have two semesters a year, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_University" title="Bond University">Bond University</a> has three. Many universities offer an optional short summer semester. One recent innovation in Australian higher education has been the establishment of the fully distance–online Open Universities Australia (formerly Open Learning Australia) that offers continuous study opportunities of individual units of study (what are called courses in North America) that can lead to full degree qualifications.</p>
<p>Open Universities Australia operates four 13-week study periods each year. Since students study only part-time and off campus these study periods mesh reasonably easily with existing university offerings based on semesters. In some cases, a "semester" is referred to as a "Study Period", for example by Centrelink.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Universities and colleges in Belgium use the semester system, dividing the academic year in two equal parts of fourteen weeks of courses. Universities start the first semester in the third week of September, and no 'autumn break'. Colleges start one week earlier, in the second week of September, giving them right to the 'autumn break' of one week. After 14 weeks of courses the 'Christmas break' starts (around December 20), which is used to study for the 3–4 weeks of examinations in January.</p>
<p>After these examinations the universities have one week of vacation, the so-called 'semestrial vacation', while the colleges start the classes of the second semester at the end of January, immediately after the examinations, which week they reclaim with the 'spring break' at the end of February, which the universities do not have. The universities start the second semester in the beginning of February.</p>
<p>Both universities and colleges have the 'Easter break', which again is used to study for the examinations in June. After Easter, the classes start again until the end of May, followed by four weeks of examinations in June, after which three months of vacation is given. The students who failed in passing some of the courses in their curriculum in January and June, the so-called 'first session', have to do the examinations again in the second session at the end of August.</p>

<p>Education being a provincial responsibility, there is no Canadian national standard. In Canada the school year for elementary and high school consists of 178 to 200 days, depending on jurisdiction, but several days may be deducted from this total for professional development and administrative duties, resulting in approximately 187 teaching days per year for most jurisdictions. Elementary students receive approximately 950 hours of instruction and secondary students receive approximately 1000 hours per year.</p>
<p>Generally in English Canada, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school" title="High school">high schools</a> run on a two-semester arrangement, also known as fall and spring semester, the first semester starting from the day after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Day#Canada" title="Labour Day">Labour Day</a> in September to mid-January and the second running from early February until the Thursday before the last Friday in June. The semesters are often divided into two terms each. Some schools in Canada run on a trimester system, the first running from September to January, the second from January to March or April, and the third from March or April until June. The trimester is more common in elementary and middle schools (Kindergarten - Grade 8) than in high schools (Grade 9 - Grade 12). Most of those characteristics differ in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Quebec" title="Education in Quebec">Québec</a>, where education is, with the exception of a few school boards, given in French.

<p>In primary and secondary schools, the school year begins the first Monday of September, unless September 1 is on Sunday. The school year is divided into trimesters. The first from September to January, the second from January to April, and the third is from April to June. There are the Autumn Holidays beginning on the week of All Saint's Day. They last about a week-and-a-half from midday Saturday before All Saint's Day to the Second Wednesday of holidays. The Christmas Holidays are from the Saturday before Christmas to the first Monday after the New Year, unless New Year's Day falls on a Sunday. The second term begins and the Winter Holidays are two weeks in February depending on region. Easter Holidays are two weeks in April depending on region. The third term begins then, and ends in early July. There is only a half week of school in July.</p>
<p>On Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays, pupils have a full day of teaching from around 8:00 a.m. until around 4:00 p.m. On Wednesday mornings, some pupils may have supplementary classes. French pupils used to attend school on Saturdays, but the so-called "four-days week" has been implemented since September 2008, reducing the teaching year from 936 to 864 hours (above the European average of 800 hours, but below the UK minimum of 950 hours for state schools).<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> Additional holidays include Veterans Day on November 11, May 8, Ascension Day, May Day on May 1, and Easter Monday.</p>

<p>The school year in Germany begins between late July and early September, and ends from mid-June to July, with a summer break of similar length to that in the UK (only 6 weeks) but much shorter than in some other countries (with up to 3 months).

<p>German universities run two semesters with the start and end dates depending on the university. The <i>Wintersemester</i> (WiSe), during which most students start university, often goes from the 1st of October till the 31st of March, with lectures starting around the 15th of October and lasting 14 weeks. There is usually a two-week break around Christmas and New Year (which is not counted in the 14 weeks). The <i>Sommersemester</i> (SoSe) consequently usually goes from the 1st of April till the 30th of September with lectures starting some time after Easter and lasting 12 weeks. The two lecture-free periods of 12 to 14 weeks between the semesters are for taking exams, doing internships, lab courses and employment.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a>, all schools start in the first half of September, even though the exact beginning date changes every year. For schools from primary schools to high schools, the academic year is split into two semesters:</p>
<ul>
<li>First semester - from September to February;</li>
<li>Second semester - from February to the beginning of June.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kindergartens usually follow a similar schedule.</p>
<p>A university academic year is slightly different because of exams. University academic year divides into:</p>
<ul>
<li>First semester - from the beginning of October to the end of February. Throughout February, there are usually no lessons, only exams.</li>
<li>Second semester - from the beginning of March to the end of July. Throughout July, there are also no lessons in most universities, only exams.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though September is a free month, it is officially an exam month in all Italian universities. It means that it is possible to take any exams of the previous year(s) that the student didn't pass. During every exam month (February, July or September), students are usually allowed to take any exam of their previous carrier that they couldn't pass and even a certain number of exams of the new academic year (credit limit for this last option).</p>

<p>In Japan, almost all schools run a three-term school year (trimester system), and most universities and colleges have a semester system. Most schools with a trimester system have a first term from April 1 to late July. The exact date of the beginning of the summer break and its duration vary across regions, but commonly the break lasts for about six weeks. The break originated to avoid the heat in summer, so elementary, middle, and high schools in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokkaidō" title="Hokkaidō" class="mw-redirect">Hokkaidō</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagano_Prefecture" title="Nagano Prefecture">Nagano Prefecture</a> tend to have a shorter summer break than the rest of schools in Japan.</p>
<p>A second term lasts from early September to late December with a two-week long break for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year%27s" title="New Year's" class="mw-redirect">New Year's</a> at the end of the year. The term is followed by a third term from early January to late March and a brief week-long <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_break" title="Spring break">spring break</a>. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduation_ceremony" title="Graduation ceremony" class="mw-redirect">graduation ceremony</a> occurs in March, and the enrollment ceremony in early April. The Japanese public school year consists of approximately 200 days, contrary to claims for a much longer school year seen in some forums.</p>
<p>Some universities and colleges accept students in September or October in order to let those students from other semester systems enroll. In recent years a few colleges have begun experimenting with having two semesters instead of the traditional three with the break between two semesters in summer.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" title="South Korea">South Korea</a>, the school year is divided into two terms. The first term usually runs from March 2, unless it is a Friday or the weekend, to mid July with the summer vacation from mid-July to late-August (elementary and secondary schools) and from mid-June to late August (higher education institutions). The second term usually resumes in late August and runs until mid February. The winter break is from late December to late January. There are two weeks of school (elementary and secondary schools) in February. Then there is a two-week-break before the new academic year starts in March.</p>
<p>The school hours are approximately from 8:00am to 4:00pm for high school, each class lasting 50 minutes. For middle school, it is about from 8:00am–3:30pm, each class lasting 45 minutes. In Primary School, the lower grades (Grades 1-3) have classes around 8:30 to 2:00 and the upper grades (Grades 4-6) have classes from about 9:00 to 3:00. Each class lasts about forty minutes.In high school, the older students are sometimes required to stay until 9:00pm or later studying on their own. For the most part, teachers rotate and the students stay in their classroom except for certain classes such as Physical Education, Music and Science labs.</p>
<p>School on Saturday ends at noon. They call Saturdays they do not attend school 놀토 (nol-to), short for 노는 토요일 (no-neun to-yo-il); it means resting Saturday. Until 2011, students went to school on the 1st, 3rd, and 5th Saturdays of each month; but from 2012, students no longer go to school on Saturdays.</p>

<p>The New Zealand school year runs from the beginning of February to mid-December, and since 1996, has been divided into four terms. By law, all state and state-integrated schools are required to be open for instruction for 380 half-days in a year (390 half-days for schools with only Year 8 students or below), meaning that the start and end of the school year is not nationally fixed to a particular date, as schools take different teacher-only days and provincial anniversary days off during the year. Schools can be exempted from opening the required number of half-days in some cases, such as in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch" title="Christchurch">Christchurch</a> in 2011 when many schools closed for up to a month after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Christchurch_earthquake" title="2011 Christchurch earthquake">2011 Christchurch earthquake</a>.

<li><b>Term 4:</b> Begins early-to-mid October; ends no later than 20 December</li>
</ul>
<p>If Easter falls in March or late in April, Term 1 usually ends in mid-April and Term 2 begins at the beginning of May. If Easter is in March, a 5-day half-term break then exists, with school ending on Maundy Thursday and resuming on the Wednesday. The start of term two may be delayed if <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anzac_Day" title="Anzac Day">Anzac Day</a> (25 April) falls on the Monday or Tuesday directly following the Easter break.</p>

<p>The Philippine school year runs for ten months, and a school year must be at least 200 days as prescribed by law. The school year begins on the first week of June and ends on the last week of March.</p>
<p>In most schools, summer break usually lasts for two months, starting from the first week of April up to the last week of May. Most schools end the school year before <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Week_in_the_Philippines" title="Holy Week in the Philippines">Holy Week</a>. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_in_the_Philippines" title="Christmas in the Philippines">Christmas</a> Break usually begins in the third week of December, and classes resume the Monday or week after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year%27s_Day" title="New Year's Day">New Year's Day</a> (unless that Monday is January 2). Commencement ceremonies are often held in late March or early April.</p>
<p>In most primary and secondary schools, an academic year is usually divided in quarters for purposes of examination and reporting of marks. Each quarter normally lasts for approximately two to two and one-half months but the actual length of each quarter varies among private schools. In most schools, each quarter culminates with a quarterly examination period of three to five days. The second quarter begins immediately after the first quarter exams. There is a one-week break between the second and third quarters called the semestral break (sem break) though some schools may officially begin their third quarter shortly before the sem break. The sem break commonly coincides with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Saints%27_Day" title="All Saints' Day">All Saints' Day</a>. The Christmas break runs for around two weeks between December and January. Some schools use all the remaining months of the school year after the Christmas break for the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>For most universities and colleges, an academic year is divided into two semesters, each up to 18 weeks long except for senior students in their final semester where they end the semester two weeks earlier. Enrollment/registration in an institution is usually good for only one semester: a student who successfully registers for the first semester is not automatically enrolled to study in the second semester. The student will need to successfully complete clearance requirements and in a few cases, maintain a certain overall mark in order to progress in her university studies in the next semester. The first semester is followed by a break consisting of two to four weeks before the second semester, called the Semestral Break, which usually occurs between the second week of October to the second week of November for all universities and colleges. The Semestral Break can be two to three weeks long, and normally includes the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Saints%27_Day" title="All Saints' Day">All Saints'</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Souls%27_Day" title="All Souls' Day">All Souls'</a> holidays.</p>

Classes start in the fourth week of May and ends in the third week of April. Under this system, students are typically able to finish their academic studies a year earlier than those from other universities with a semestral programme. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapúa_Institute_of_Technology" title="Mapúa Institute of Technology">Mapúa Institute of Technology</a> began using the quarterly system with eleven weeks to a term after its acquisition by the Yuchengco Group.

There is also a winter holiday break lasting two weeks in January or February but the exact date is different for each province and the dates usually change each year. Winter break is also the dividing line between the two semesters of the school year.</p>
<p>Most universities start their courses on October 1 (at some institutions late September), and ending in January. The first semester of the academic year is commonly referred to as the "<i>winter term</i>". In February or March, the second term (the "<i>summer term</i>") starts. It finishes in June. Each semester is usually 15 or 16 weeks long. After each of them there is an "<i>examination session</i>", when no courses are taught, which lasts up to one month. Summer break starts after the exams and lasts until the start of the next academic year. In September there is an extra examination session during which students can retake failed exams.</p>

The long terms then require a half-term break to give pupils and teachers time to recharge.</p>
<p>The long summer holiday has often been criticised by educationalists who say that the long breaks delay academic progress.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> Even a House of Commons Education Select Committee recommended in 1999 that schools switch to a five-term academic year, abolishing the long summer holidays. Each term would be eight weeks long with a two-week break in between terms, and a minimum four-week summer holiday, with no half terms—the idea being that children can keep up momentum for eight weeks without a break.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup> The proposals were introduced at a small number of schools nationally.</p>
<p>In 1999, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government_Association" title="Local Government Association">Local Government Association</a> set up a commission to look at alternative proposals for a more balanced school year. In partnership with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government#United_Kingdom" title="Local government">Local Authorities</a> and teachers unions, they were unable to agree to a suitable alternative arrangement for terms, but by 2004 came to an agreement with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Schoolmasters_Union_of_Women_Teachers" title="National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers" class="mw-redirect">National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers</a> for a standardised arrangement of school terms. Since 2004, around one third of English local authorities have signed up to the proposals which see a standard academic year agreed between the authorities, including slight variations on the traditional schemes, based on the following principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>start the school year on a September date as near as possible to 1 September;</li>
<li>equalise teaching and learning blocks (roughly 2×7 and 4×6 weeks);</li>
<li>establish a two-week spring break in early April irrespective of the incidence of the Easter bank holiday. (Where the break does not coincide with the bank holiday the date should be, as far as practicable, nationally agreed and as consistent as possible across all local authorities);</li>
<li>allow for the possibility of a summer holiday of at least six weeks for those schools which want this length of break.</li>
<li>identify and agree annually designated periods of holiday, including the summer holiday, where head teachers are recommended not to arrange teacher days.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition the independent schools have set their own term dates with varying degrees of local and national co-ordination.</p>

<p>There are a lot of differing practices that use confusingly similar terminology. Many universities run ten-week autumn, spring and summer terms, though some use different names or a semester system, with the new semester beginning halfway through the second term. Many other universities run terms of uneven length, with the autumn term usually the longest. Even within individual institutions practice can vary from year to year to accommodate factors such as the changing date of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter" title="Easter">Easter</a>. Some universities also have a "reading week" in which no teaching takes place at all, the equivalent of a school half term. At other universities "reading weeks" are not uniform and may be in different weeks in different faculties, departments, modules or even seminar groups. Some reading weeks cover only seminars whilst lectures continue; others suspend both for the week.</p>

<li>Candlemas: 2 February, Candlemas, which fell forty days after Christmas, marked the presentation of the infant Jesus in the temple and the purification of the Virgin Mary.</li>
<li>Whitsunday: originally a moveable term day, coming the seventh Sunday after Easter, was fixed in Scotland at 15 May in 1693. Whitsunday was originally the feast of Pentecost, around which a great many christenings would occur, so it became associated with the color white.</li>
<li>Lammas Day: 1 August, feast of St. Peter ad Vincula was a corruption of loaf-mass, the Sunday on which the first fruits of harvest were offered, first corn ground, and first loaf made. In Scotland it was associated with hand-fasting and some fairs on this day were called handfasting fairs. (Originally synonymous with betrothal, handfasting became a contract binding a man and woman to live together for a year and a day before they decided on permanent marriage.)</li>
<li>Martinmas: 11 November, was known as St. Martin in Winter or St. Martin of Tours to distinguish this from another feast of St. Martin in July.</li>

<p>In the United States, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K–12_education" title="K–12 education" class="mw-redirect">K–12</a> school calendar is determined by the individual states, and in some cases by the local school district, so there is considerable variation except for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holidays_in_the_United_States" title="Public holidays in the United States">national holidays</a>. The academic year typically consists of two 18-week semesters, each divided into two nine-week marking periods (or quarters) or three six-week marking periods, and constituting 170 to 186 instructional days (with an average of 180).<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (March 2012)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> An instructional week is five instructional days, measured Monday–Friday at all public and most private schools; Saturday–Wednesday or Sunday–Thursday at Muslim private schools; and so on. Grades are usually reported per marking period, but major examinations are given per semester or per year.</p>
<p>The traditional start date for the school year has been the first Tuesday in September (the day after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Day" title="Labor Day">Labor Day</a>). Though some schools still keep this tradition, many schools now start in the last two weeks of August and some schools (especially private ones) may start as late as the end of September or the first week in October. There are also some schools, especially in the southern tier of the United States, that begin at the end of July and early August. The school year ends 42 instructional weeks after it begins. Also, some schools are now moving to the first Wednesday in September (usually two days after Labor Day, unless it falls on September 1 or 2) to allow a short week as students adjust to being in school again.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_holiday#United_States" title="School holiday">School holidays in the United States</a> vary by jurisdiction and in addition to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holidays_in_the_United_States" title="Public holidays in the United States">national, state, and local holidays</a>, typically include additional breaks around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving_(United_States)" title="Thanksgiving (United States)">Thanksgiving</a>, winter break around Christmas and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Year%27s_Day" title="New Year's Day">New Year's Day</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_break" title="Spring break">spring break</a> in March or April. Some schools have additional holidays for students that are workdays for the staff, such as parent–teacher conference days, though other schools dismiss students early. The aggregate of school holidays typically amounts to more than 70 weekdays, so an academic year that starts the last week of August or first week of September (usually the day after Labor Day in September) will typically finish the first week of June. Schools that start in late July or early August end in late May. In northern states, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_day" title="Snow day" class="mw-redirect">snow days</a> typically extend the ending of the school year to make up for the missed instructional time.</p>

<p>Three calendar systems are used by most American colleges and universities: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_quarter_(year_division)" title="Academic quarter (year division)">quarter system</a>, semester system, and trimester system. These are ways the calendar year, measured September–August or August–August, is organized into a formal academic year. Some schools, particularly some business schools and community colleges, use the mini-mester or mini-semester system.</p>
<p>The quarter system divides the calendar year into four quarters, three of which constitute a complete academic year. Quarters are typically 10 weeks long so that three quarters amount to 30 weeks of instruction. Approximately 20% of universities are on the quarter system. Most colleges that use the quarter system have a fall quarter from late September to mid-December, a winter quarter from early January to mid-March, a spring quarter from late March or early April to mid-June, and an optional summer session. Notable users of the quarter system include the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California" title="University of California">University of California</a> system (excluding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley" title="University of California, Berkeley">Berkeley</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Merced" title="University of California, Merced">Merced</a>) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago" title="University of Chicago">University of Chicago</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The semester system divides the calendar year into two semesters of 15 weeks each, plus summer sessions of varying lengths. The two semesters together constitute 30 weeks of instruction, so that three academic quarters equal two academic semesters. Thus, academic credit earned in quarter hours converts to semester hours at 2/3 of its value, while credit earned in semester hours converts to quarter hours at 3/2 of its value. Put another way, 3 quarter hours is 2 semester hours. Most<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

<p>In practice, the average quarter-long course is four or five units and the average semester course is three units, so a full-time student graduating in four years would take five courses per semester and three or four courses per quarter.</p>
<p>Some colleges and universities have a 4-1-4 system, which divides the year into two four-month terms (September to December and February to May) as well as a single one-month term in January in which students can do independent study, study abroad, internships, activities, or focus on one or two classes. The one-month term is sometimes called a <i>mini-mester</i>, <i>winter session</i>, <i>inter-term/interim/intersession</i> or <i>J-term</i>.

<p>Some schools have a similar format but ordered as 4-4-1, with the short term in May after the conclusion of the spring semester.

The fall and winter and spring trimesters constitute an academic year of 30–32 weeks.<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27"><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup> The reduced maximum course load that accompanies the shortening from the traditional semester makes the trimester system compatible with the semester system. Academic credit is thus measured on the trimester system in semester hours; there is no such thing as a "trimester hour" of credit.</p>
<p>At the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan" title="University of Michigan">University of Michigan</a>, for example, the Fall trimester (informally still called 'semester') operates from September through December; the Winter trimester runs from January through April; and the Spring-Summer trimester operates from May through August, as two half-trimesters. Most Spring-Summer classes either meet double-time for 7–8 weeks in May and June or double-time/double-plus-time for 6–8 weeks in July and August (with summer half-term classes sometimes starting in the last week of June).</p>
<p>A number of colleges have adopted the "one course at a time" or "block schedule" calendar.
